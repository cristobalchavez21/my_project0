                    This is  Pipa, she is the oldest of our pets. She came to the
					family as a birthday present after our oldest dog died.
					Pipa LOVES to eat and is very lazy
					so now she's a bit fat. She likes to be pet and is very loyal.
					She has a nice temper, although you should be careful with her tail
					as she is the biggest of our dogs and waves her tail very hard when she's happy.

                    This is Nube, which means cloud in Spanish. My brother adopted her from the street when she was little and thought it would be funny to name her “cloud” considering she is all black. She has a lot of long black hair, which makes it really hard to wash. She is a little bit shy, because of her past on the streets and has the weird ability to climb (not jump) fences.

                    This is Nala, named after the character from the movie The Lion king. She is the daughter of one of our older dogs, and sister of Alpha and Bubba. She was the smallest and the only female of her litter and now is very shy. She is very well-behaved and obedient, unlike her brothers.

                    This is Alpha, brother of Nala and Bubba. When they were born, I wanted to name them Alpha, Beta and Gamma. None of my family members liked that idea, but they agreed to name him Alpha. He is almost identical to his brother Bubba, and we used to confuse them all the time. Unfortunately, last year he ran away and fought with another dog ending badly wounded. He lost a leg, and spent a lot of time recovering, but now he is as happy as any other dog. At least we don’t confuse him with his brother anymore.

					This is Bubba, the strongest and the “leader” of our dogs. He has a bad temper and likes to fight other dogs. Because of that he has a lot of scars, and the rest of our dogs respect/fear him. Despite his bad temper, he is not aggressive to humans and has never bitten anyone. He is very problematic as he’s always digging holes in the fence to get out and fight other dogs (he is very good at destroying the fence). But when he’s not causing troubles he es a lovely loyal dog.
